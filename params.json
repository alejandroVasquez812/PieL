{"name":"Piel","tagline":"A programming language for Spanish speakers","body":"# PieL\r\nA programming language for Spanish speakers\r\n\r\n### Java\r\nFor this project you will need to have the JDK installed and in your path. You can find the JDK [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html )\r\n\r\nTo verify if java is installed and in your system path open a terminal and type\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -version\r\n```\r\nYou should receive the version in the next line.\r\n\r\n\r\n### JavaCC\r\nYou will also need to install JavaCC. To download  visit the [JavaCC Homepage](https://javacc.java.net/ \"JavaCC Home\").\r\n\r\n### Building PieL\r\n\r\n1. Open Terminal on the folder where the .jj file is along with the javacc.jar file is.\r\n2. Run these commands\r\n```bash\r\njava -cp \"path to javacc.jar\" javacc \"path to PieL.jj\"\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\njavac *.java\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Instructions to run the language:\r\n1. Run a terminal inside the folder where the parser,lexer and intermidiate code reside.\r\n```bash\r\njava PieL\r\n```\r\n3. This will allow you to start writing code in the PieL Language.\r\n\r\nExample code to write (the words inside the quotations are to be replaced for information of your choice ex. ID would be the name of a variable you have created):\r\n\r\na) Crea un \"TYPE\" llamado \"ID\" con valor (\"STRING\" OR \"NUMBER\" OR \"ID\").\r\n\r\nb) Crea un \"STRUCT\" de \"TYPE\" llamado \"ID\" y valores [ \"MULTITERM\" ].\r\n\r\nc) Si (\"STRING\" OR \"NUMBER\" OR \"ID\") es igual a (\"STRING\" OR \"NUMBER\" OR \"ID\") {\"insert instructions here\"}.\r\n\r\nd) Imprime \"ID\".\r\n\r\ne) Imprime arreglo o lista \"ID\".\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
